Recommender Systems have a long history using matrix factorization as primary method. Nowaday, in many cases Graph Neural Networks can be used to improve recommender systems, as they allow a broader aggregation of the neighborhood and therefore lead to more powerful representations. In this video I teach all the basics you need to get started with GNNs + recommenders :)

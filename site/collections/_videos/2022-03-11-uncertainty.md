Being able to predict uncertainty is a very powerful skill for every Data Scientist!
It not only provides better insights into the machine learning model, but also helps the end-users to build trust in your application.
This video series consists of 4 videos, which talk about both - the theory and implementation of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. Captured methods include Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Quantile Regression, Deep Ensembles, and Bayesian Neural Networks.

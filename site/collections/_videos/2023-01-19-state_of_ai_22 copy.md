Equivariant Deep Learning aims to integrate certain priors into the model architecture, to make the algorithms robust against transformations of the input (so called symmetries). In this video I talk about the basics of equivariant deep learning, such as Group Convolutions and also show how to integrate equivariance into more recent models like Transformers and GNNs.

Contrastive Learning is a very interesting approach for pretraining and representation learning. There are many frameworks and different loss functions out there and in this video I have an introduction to the most popular ones. 
In part 2 we perform representation learning on point clouds to learn self-supervised contrastive embeddings.

Enjoy!

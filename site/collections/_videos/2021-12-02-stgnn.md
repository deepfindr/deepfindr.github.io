Combining time-series models with graph models has led to amazing breakthroughs in fields like Traffic Prediction. Google has recently published a paper where the spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network outperformed the current ETA prediction model. 
In this video I give a friendly introduction to these models and explain their inner workings.

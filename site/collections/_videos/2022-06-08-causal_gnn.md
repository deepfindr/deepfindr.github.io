Causality answers the question of "What if" and is a useful tool to understand the reasoning process of data. Recent works have started to combine Graph Neural Networks with Structural Causal Models (SCMs) which opens a new promising research direction. The ultimate goal is to combine the best of both worlds to jointly learn causal relationships and powerful models. More about it in this video ...

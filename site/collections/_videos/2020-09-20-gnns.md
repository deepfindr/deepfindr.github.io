This is a beginner video series in which I explain how Graph Neural Networks work and demostrate how to implement them using Pytorch Geometric. The series consists of three parts. Part 1 is a general introduction, part 2 goes into detail what Message Passing is and how to calculate it and part 3 is a hands-on session using a molecule dataset.

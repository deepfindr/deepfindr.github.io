In most cases Graph Neural Networks are trained to perform link, node or graph-level regression and classification. For all of these cases labels are needed to fit the model in a supervised manner. What do you do however if you don't have any labels but still want to learn expressive representations of the nodes? In this case self-supervised or unsupervised approaches are needed and in this video I present a couple of ways to do this :)

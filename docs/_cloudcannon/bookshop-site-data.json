I have an Engineering and Computer Science background and have always loved teaching since I gave guitar lessons 10+ years ago. Once I got involved into programming and tech the logical consequence was to do the same thing there: share knowledge. </p> <p> <h1>What does the name DeepFindr stand for? </h1> The name for the channel was a spontaneous idea and I would probably choose another name meanwhile ;-). You could say that the \"Deep\" part refers to Deep Learning and the \"Findr\" part to finding knowledge.  To that end, the goal of this channel is to share compressed and insightful Machine Learning knowledge.  </p> <p> <h1>Why does DeepFindr exist? </h1> I created this channel for several reasons. First of all, I love to be in contact with people from all over the world and like to exchange on the latest topics. Besides that, I have many friends that started with Machine Learning and had  struggles understanding the university slides. That's why I thought it would be a great opportunity to animate and visualize complex subjects. Finally, I don't want to withhold from you that I hoped to get a little extra income to go out for a dinner every now and then. :) </p>"}],"slug":"about","ext":".html","tags":[],"excerpt":"","date":"2022-07-23 11:38:50 +0200","content":"","url":"/about/","relative_path":"_pages/about.html","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","title":"Consuting","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"page-heading","title":"Need Mentorship or Consultancy?","description":null},{"_bookshop_name":"content","content_html":"<p>\n  I get a lot of messages every day from people asking for help in their projects. \n  So far I answered every request and invested a lot of freetime into supporting and consulting. \n\n  As of now, <b>I decided to only take smaller questions</b>, because I can't handle the large amount of inquries anymore.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  If you need further assistance and also coding support, <b>I offer consultancy</b> but not free of charge anymore.\n</p>\n<a href= \"mailto:deepfindr@gmail.com\">For more details get in touch via deepfindr@gmail.com.</a>"}],"slug":"consulting","ext":".html","tags":[],"excerpt":"","date":"2022-07-23 11:38:50 +0200","content":"","url":"/consulting/","relative_path":"_pages/consulting.html","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","title":"Contact","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"page-heading","title":"Get in touch!"},{"_bookshop_name":"content","content_html":"<p> If you are interested in any form of collaboration or just want to leave feedback, please do so using the E-Mail address below. </p>\n<a href= \"mailto:deepfindr@gmail.com\">Click to send E-Mail to deepfindr@gmail.com.</a>"}],"slug":"contact","ext":".html","tags":[],"excerpt":"","date":"2022-07-23 11:38:50 +0200","content":"","url":"/contact/","relative_path":"_pages/contact.html","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","title":"Consuting","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"content","content_html":"<p>\n  <h1>Datenschutzerklärung</h1>\n  <h2> YouTube </h2>\n  Der von mir genutzte YouTube Kanal gehört Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Irland.\n  Angaben darüber, welche Daten durch Google verarbeitet und zu welchen Zwecken\n  genutzt werden, finden Sie in der <a href=https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de&gl=de#infocollect>Datenschutzerklärung von Google</a>.\n  \n  Ich habe keinen Einfluss auf Art und Umfang der durch Google\n  verarbeiteten Daten, die Art der Verarbeitung und Nutzung oder die Weitergabe\n  dieser Daten an Dritte.\n\n  <h2> GMail </h2>\n  Zur Kontaktaufnahme verwende ich den E-Mail Dienst G-Mail.\n  Die Datenschutzerklärung von G-Mail finden Sie <a href=https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10434152?hl=de>hier</a>.\n  Ich verarbeite personenbezogene Daten wie E-Mail Addressen oder Namen nicht weiter und gebe diese auch nicht an Externe weiter.\n  Auf Anfrage können alle gespeicherten Daten aus einer Kontaktaufnahme sofort gelöscht werden, falls dies gewünscht wird.\n\n</p>"}],"slug":"data_privacy","ext":".html","tags":[],"excerpt":"","date":"2022-07-23 11:38:50 +0200","content":"","url":"/data_privacy/","relative_path":"_pages/data_privacy.html","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","permalink":"/","title":"Home","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"hero","title":"Hi there!","description_html":"<p>I'm  <strong>Data Science Enthusiast</strong> and <strong>Programming Lover</strong>.

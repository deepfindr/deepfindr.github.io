I have an Engineering and Computer Science background and have always loved teaching since I gave guitar lessons 10+ years ago. Once I got involved into programming and tech the logical consequence was to do the same thing there: share knowledge. </p> <p> <h1>What does the name DeepFindr stand for? </h1> The name for the channel was a spontaneous idea and I would probably choose another name meanwhile ;-). You could say that the \"Deep\" part refers to Deep Learning and the \"Findr\" part to finding knowledge.  To that end, the goal of this channel is to share compressed and insightful Machine Learning knowledge.  </p> <p> <h1>Why does DeepFindr exist? </h1> I created this channel for several reasons. First of all, I love to be in contact with people from all over the world and like to exchange on the latest topics. Besides that, I have many friends that started with Machine Learning and had  struggles understanding the university slides. That's why I thought it would be a great opportunity to animate and visualize complex subjects. Finally, I don't want to withhold from you that I hoped to get a little extra income to go out for a dinner every now and then. :) </p>"}],"slug":"about","ext":".html","tags":[],"excerpt":"","date":"2023-02-26 12:50:37 +0100","content":"","url":"/about/","relative_path":"_pages/about.html","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","title":"Blog","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"page-heading","title":"Blog","description":"Vonge blog features productivity, tips, inspiration and strategies for massive profits.
